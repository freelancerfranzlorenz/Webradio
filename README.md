# Webradio

## Description
A small HTML5 based webradio, showing you the potential of HTML5 Webaudio functionality.

## How to use
Just start the webradio.html with your favourite webbrowser and enjoy the music
(if you have internet access ;-).<br/>
You can also copy this file to your mobile phone and use it. It works on my android 
mobile phone with the chrome webbrowser.

## 3rd party
W3CSS is a powerful and free framework for websites. I love it :-)<br/>
